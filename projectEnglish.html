            <p>As <strong>Vice-President of Communication and Events</strong> at the ARECE automotive association from June 2021 to May 2023, I actively contributed to the development of an autonomous single-seater software for the Formula Student international competition at Silverstone. I coordinated the association's communication activities and organized key events related to our project. This experience allowed me to develop project management, strategic communication, and event organization skills, while gaining technical expertise in autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <p>I mainly worked on the <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> part of the project in my team of 7 members. Our goal was to create a robot capable of picking up and moving cubes to specific locations. I was responsible for implementing the A* algorithm for the robot's movement. Using this algorithm, I developed an effective strategy for the robot to plan its movements and optimize cube collection in the end-of-year competition. Additionally, I contributed to other aspects of the project such as <strong>robot assembly</strong>, <strong>modeling some parts</strong>, <strong>reading received images</strong>, and <strong>communicating with the server</strong>.</p>

We designed an innovative remote that radio-controls a drone (NRF24L01) while complying with regulatory frequencies. An OLED screen displays real-time crucial information, while two joysticks ensure smooth control of altitude and direction. Thanks to our smart choice of the ATmega328P microcontroller and the integration of an inertial measurement unit, the drone benefits from exemplary stability and precision. This project reflects our passion for technological innovation and cutting-edge engineering.</p>

I set up a synchronous counter to generate a clock signal, slowing down the DE-10 lite signal from 50MHz to 1Hz. To inform drivers, I used a Moore machine to implement two traffic lights. As for pedestrians, I developed a system to indicate the state of the light and the remaining waiting time, displayed on a 7-segment display or through a sound effect.</p>

            <p>In my first year during the confinement, I undertook a project to build a digital synthesizer at home. The VCO block used an NE555 to generate a rectangular signal whose frequency depended on the keyboard keys. An op-amp served as an integrator to modify the shape of the signal, and a potentiometer allowed sound sculpting. The VCF followed, modifying the output signal of the integrator using two potentiometers. Finally, the output signal was sent to the speaker to hear the synthesized sound. This project introduced me to sound synthesis and handling electronic components.</p>
